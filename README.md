# Background Task Terminator

Background Task Terminator is a project aimed at enhancing operating system performance by detecting and terminating applications that are idle. This tool minimizes CPU usage and improves overall resource management. It features an intuitive pop-up notification system that informs users about inactive applications and provides a direct option to terminate them.

## Features
- **Idle Application Detection**: Monitors applications to identify those that have remained inactive for a set period, thereby optimizing resource utilization.
- **Resource Optimization**: Lowers CPU load by closing idle tasks, contributing to better system efficiency.
- **Pop-up Notification System**: Notifies users when applications exceed the idle time limit, offering a straightforward way to terminate them.
- **User Control**: Grants users the ability to effectively manage system resources by enabling the selection and termination of idle applications via the notification interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Python

## Architecture
1. **Idle Detection Module**: Observes system applications and flags those that are idle based on defined thresholds.
2. **Notification System**: Creates pop-up alerts when idle applications are identified.
3. **Task Termination Module**: Facilitates users in terminating selected idle applications directly from the notification.
